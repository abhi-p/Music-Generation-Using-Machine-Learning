Note: 

3 MIDI files are played for the user in each demo. 
The first one is the audio that they played after data transformations outlined by project requirements are applied.
This is so that the user can see discrepencies between what they played and what was actually recorded

The second one is audio generated by the model, without any post processing to reduce granularity

The third one is audio generated by the model that has gone through post processing
